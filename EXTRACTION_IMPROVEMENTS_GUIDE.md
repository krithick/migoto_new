## üîç What Extraction Needs to Do

### Task 1: Extract Mode Descriptions

**From document text, identify:**

1. **Learn Mode:**
   - What happens? (training, teaching, explaining)
   - Who is AI? (trainer, expert, instructor)
   - Who is learner? (FSO, employee, student)
   - What's being taught? (methodology, policy, skills)
   - Named methodology? (IMPACT, SPIN, KYC, etc.)

2. **Assess Mode:**
   - What happens? (practice conversation, simulation)
   - Who is AI? (customer, doctor, colleague)
   - Who is learner? (sales rep, employee, agent)
   - What's the context? (office, store, phone)

3. **Try Mode:**
   - Is it different from assess? (usually same)
   - Is coaching enabled? (yes/no)

**Example from pharma doc:**
```
"The FSO will learn the IMPACT methodology from an expert trainer..."
‚Üí learn_mode: {
    "what_happens": "Expert trainer teaches IMPACT",
    "ai_bot_role": "Sales trainer",
    "methods": ["IMPACT"]
}

"Then practice pitching to Dr. Archana Pandey, a gynecologist..."
‚Üí assess_mode: {
    "what_happens": "Practice pitch to gynecologist",
    "ai_bot_role": "Gynecologist being pitched to"
}
```

### Task 2: Extract Persona TYPES (not instances)

**Critical distinction:**

**Persona TYPE** (category):
- "Experienced Gynecologist" 
- "First-time Mother"
- "Bias Victim"

**Persona INSTANCE** (specific character):
- "Dr. Archana Pandey, 42, female, at Jawahar Medical"
- "Priya Sharma, 28, expecting first child"
- "Maya, team member who experienced exclusion"

**From document, extract:**

1. **What TYPE of character is this?**
   - Professional role/category
   - Life situation
   - Social role

2. **Key characteristics of this TYPE:**
   - Expertise level
   - Decision-making style
   - What they care about
   - What frustrates them

3. **NOT the specific name/age/gender** (that's generated later)

**Example from pharma doc:**
```
"Dr. Archana Pandey is an experienced gynecologist who treats 
endometriosis patients. She currently uses Dienogest but has 
concerns about irregular bleeding and bone loss..."

‚Üí Extract as PERSONA TYPE:
{
    "type": "Experienced Gynecologist",
    "description": "Senior doctor specializing in endometriosis",
    "key_characteristics": {
        "specialty": "Gynecology - Endometriosis",
        "decision_style": "Evidence-based, analytical",
        "current_solution": "Uses Dienogest",
        "pain_points": ["Irregular bleeding", "Bone loss"],
        "time_constraints": "Very busy, limited time"
    }
}

NOTE: Name "Dr. Archana Pandey" becomes part of the TYPE description,
but we can generate "Dr. Rajesh Kumar" or "Dr. Meera Shah" 
with same characteristics later!
```

### Task 3: Extract Domain Knowledge Structure

**From document, identify and structure:**

1. **Named Methodology?**
   - IMPACT, SPIN, KYC, Socratic method, etc.
   - If yes ‚Üí Extract steps/stages

2. **Subject Matter:**
   - Product (EO-Dine)
   - Policy (DEI policy)
   - Service (maternity package)
   - Process (complaint handling)

3. **Learning Content:**
   - Key facts (what learner must know)
   - Dos and Don'ts
   - Topics to cover

4. **Evaluation Criteria:**
   - What makes a good conversation?
   - What are common mistakes?
   - How to score?

5. **Coaching Rules:**
   - When should coach intervene?
   - What should coach say?
   - What mistakes to catch?

**Example extraction:**

```
Document says:
"The FSO should follow IMPACT: Introduce, Motivate, Present, 
Address, Close, Thank. They must provide evidence-based data, 
not vague claims. Common mistakes include skipping the Motivate 
step and giving generic statements."

‚Üí Extract:
{
    "methodology": "IMPACT",
    "methodology_steps": ["Introduce", "Motivate", "Present", ...],
    "dos": ["Provide evidence-based data", "Be specific"],
    "donts": ["Make vague claims", "Give generic statements"],
    "common_mistakes": ["Skipping Motivate step", "Generic statements"],
    "coaching_rules": {
        "what_to_catch": ["Skipped methodology steps", "Vague claims"]
    }
}
```

### Task 4: Identify Detail Category Hints

**OPTIONAL but helpful:**

From document context, suggest which detail categories might be relevant.

**Example:**
```
Document mentions:
- "Dr. Archana has a surgery scheduled" ‚Üí time_constraints
- "She's seen this FSO before" ‚Üí past_experiences / sales_rep_history
- "She treats endometriosis patients" ‚Üí professional_context
- "Family considerations important" ‚Üí family_context

‚Üí Extract hint:
{
    "suggested_detail_categories": [
        "professional_context",
        "time_constraints", 
        "sales_rep_history"
    ]
}
```

**Note:** LLM will still make final decision, but this helps!

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Strategy

### Approach: Multi-Pass LLM Extraction

Instead of one big prompt, do **multiple focused extractions**:

```python
async def extract_scenario_info_v2(document_text, client):
    """
    Enhanced extraction with multiple passes
    """
    
    # Pass 1: Basic info + mode identification
    basic_info = await extract_basic_info_and_modes(document_text, client)
    
    # Pass 2: Persona type extraction (for assess mode)
    persona_types = await extract_persona_types(document_text, client)
    
    # Pass 3: Domain knowledge extraction
    domain_knowledge = await extract_domain_knowledge(document_text, client)
    
    # Pass 4: Coaching & evaluation extraction
    coaching_eval = await extract_coaching_and_evaluation(document_text, client)
    
    # Pass 5: Archetype classification (existing)
    archetype = await classify_archetype(document_text, client)
    
    # Combine all
    template_data = {
        **basic_info,
        "assess_mode": {
            **basic_info.get("assess_mode", {}),
            "persona_types": persona_types
        },
        "domain_knowledge": {
            **domain_knowledge,
            **coaching_eval
        },
        "archetype_classification": archetype
    }
    
    return template_data
```

**Why multiple passes?**
- ‚úÖ Each pass focuses on ONE thing (better quality)
- ‚úÖ Can run in parallel (faster)
- ‚úÖ Easier to debug (know which pass failed)
- ‚úÖ Can cache/reuse parts

---

## üìù Implementation Details

### Pass 1: Basic Info + Modes

**Purpose:** Extract title, description, and what happens in each mode

   - Teaching focus (what's the main learning objective)
   - Named methodology? (e.g., IMPACT, SPIN, KYC) - if mentioned
   - Uses vector DB? (does it reference supporting documents)

3. **Assess Mode:**
   - What happens? (what is being practiced/simulated)
   - AI bot role (who is the AI playing - customer, doctor, colleague)
   - Learner role (who is the learner playing)

## ‚úÖ Integration with Existing System

**Don't replace existing extraction! Add alongside:**

```python
# In your existing service file

# EXISTING (keep as-is)
async def extract_scenario_info(self, document_text):
    """Original extraction - keep for backwards compatibility"""
    # ... existing code ...
    pass

# NEW V2 (add this)
async def extract_scenario_info_v2(self, document_text):
    """Enhanced extraction with persona types, coaching, evaluation"""
    from core.scenario_extractor_v2 import ScenarioExtractorV2

        print("[INFO] Falling back to V1 extraction")
        return await self.extract_scenario_info(document_text)
```

---

## üß™ Testing

**Test with your pharma scenario:**

```python
# Test extraction
extractor = ScenarioExtractorV2(client)
result = await extractor.extract_scenario_info(pharma_document)

# Check results
print("Title:", result["title"])
print("Learn mode:", result["learn_mode"])
print("Assess mode:", result["assess_mode"])
print("Persona types:", result["assess_mode"]["persona_types"])
print("Domain knowledge:", result["domain_knowledge"])
print("Coaching rules:", result["domain_knowledge"]["coaching_rules"])
print("Evaluation:", result["domain_knowledge"]["evaluation_criteria"])
```

---

## üìã Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Create `scenario_extractor_v2.py`
2. ‚úÖ Test with existing scenarios
3. ‚úÖ Verify persona types are extracted correctly
4. ‚úÖ Check domain knowledge structure
5. ‚úÖ Validate coaching/eval extraction

**Then:** Connect with persona generation system! üéØ
