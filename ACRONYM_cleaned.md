## Sales Representative Background
The FSO is from Integrace Orthopedics, a top 100 pharma company in India, makers of Dubinor, Lizolid and Esoz, trusted by over 34,000 Indian doctors and leaders in neuropathic pain and PAD treatment. This is a follow-up visit to launch the new EO-Dine product.

## Previous Interaction History
The FSO has visited Dr. Archana multiple times over recent months promoting other products but has not yet secured prescriptions. This creates some urgency to demonstrate value and build trust.

## Conversation Approach
The FSO needs to establish credibility, reference previous visits, understand the doctor's current treatment challenges, present relevant EO-Dine benefits, address any concerns, and secure a prescription commitment for appropriate endometriosis patients.

## Dr. Archana's Current Treatment Approach
Currently uses Dienogest for endometriosis patients but has concerns about long-term side effects including irregular bleeding and bone loss. She values evidence-based treatments with proven safety profiles.

## Dr. Archana's Typical Concerns
- Patient compliance with long-term treatments
- Side effect profiles of new medications
- Cost-effectiveness for her patient population
- Dosing convenience for busy patients
- Comparative efficacy data versus established treatments

## Conversation Context
The FSO is launching EO-Dine to Dr. Archana, who treats many endometriosis cases in her metro practice. The doctor is busy with her OPD and has limited time before her surgical procedure.
