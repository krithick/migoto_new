## Conversation Summary
- **Document Extraction Issues**: User reported missing data when uploading Word documents to their flexible scenario generator system, with many fields showing empty arrays or generic placeholders instead of actual extracted content
- **Template Structure Problems**: The extraction logic wasn't properly parsing the filled.md template format with numbered sections (Section 3.1, 5.2, etc.) and was generating generic training content instead of extracting specific document content
- **Character Alignment Issues**: Feedback mechanisms were generating generic training responses instead of character-specific responses aligned with the AI personas defined in the template
- **Token Limitations**: System was hitting token limits preventing comprehensive data extraction and generation

## Files and Code Summary
- **d:\migoto_dev\migoto_new\enhanced_scenario_generator.py**: Main extraction logic file containing flexible_extract_from_document method that processes uploaded documents and extracts training scenario data
- **d:\migoto_dev\migoto_new\scenario_generator.py**: Contains DOCX extraction functions (extract_text_from_docx) and file processing endpoints for handling Word document uploads
- **d:\migoto_dev\migoto_new\FlexibleScenarioGenerator.tsx**: React frontend component with interfaces for ExtractedData, ValidationData, and Template structures

## Key Insights
- **Template Format**: The system expects a specific template structure with numbered sections (Section 3.1: AI Trainer Role, Section 5.2: Success Metrics, etc.) that wasn't being properly extracted
- **Character-Specific Design**: AI should play specific roles (victim/bystander/perpetrator from Section 3.2) rather than generic trainer/customer roles, with feedback responses matching the character persona
- **Extraction Source Tracking**: All fields include extraction_source markers ("FROM_DOCUMENT" vs "GENERATED_CONTENT") to show what was actually extracted versus AI-generated content
- **Word Document Processing**: DOCX extraction can fail due to complex formatting, requiring fallback methods and enhanced debugging

## Most Recent Topic
**Topic**: Fixing document extraction logic to properly parse Word documents and populate all template fields with meaningful content

**Progress**: Enhanced the extraction system to properly handle Word documents, increased token limits, and fixed field population issues

**Tools Used**:
- **fsReplace on enhanced_scenario_generator.py**: Updated flexible_extract_from_document method to extract EXACT content from specific template sections, increased max_tokens from 8000‚Üí16000, added comprehensive field population logic, and implemented character-specific feedback generation
- **fsReplace on scenario_generator.py**: Enhanced extract_text_from_docx function with better debugging, table extraction, and fallback methods for handling Word document processing failures
- **Multiple fsReplace operations**: Updated fallback data structures to include extraction_source fields, replaced generic placeholders with domain-specific content, and aligned feedback mechanisms with character personas rather than generic training responses

also remember this 
Here&#39;s what I should remember before moving on:

Key Issues Fixed:
1. Document Extraction Problems:

Word document extraction was failing silently

Added enhanced debugging and fallback methods

Fixed table extraction for structured template data

Added validation to ensure sufficient content is extracted

2. Missing Data Fields:

Many fields were returning empty arrays or generic placeholders

Fixed extraction logic to populate ALL fields with meaningful content

Added domain-specific content generation for missing sections

Ensured extraction_source tracking works properly

3. Template Structure Alignment:

Fixed extraction to look for specific template sections (Section 3.1, 5.2, etc.)

Character-specific feedback instead of generic training responses

Proper persona alignment (AI plays specific roles, not generic trainer/customer)

Document-first extraction with intelligent fallbacks

4. Token Limits:

Increased max_tokens from 8000 ‚Üí 16000 for comprehensive extraction

Increased prompt generation tokens from 4000 ‚Üí 8000

Enhanced validation and enhancement tokens to 16000

Critical Extraction Priorities:
Section 3.1: AI Trainer Role ‚Üí participant_roles.expert_role

Section 3.2: AI Colleague Role ‚Üí participant_roles.practice_role

Section 4.2: Common Situations ‚Üí knowledge_base.dos

Section 5.1: Correction preferences ‚Üí coaching_rules.correction_preferences

Section 5.2: Success Metrics ‚Üí success_metrics.kpis_for_interaction

Section 7.3: Common Mistakes ‚Üí knowledge_base.donts

Character-Specific Requirements:
AI should play victim/bystander/perpetrator roles from document

Feedback should be character-specific, not generic training responses

Learn Mode: AI = Senior HR Trainer (teaches leadership)

Assess/Try Mode: AI = Character needing help (stays in role)

The system now properly extracts from Word documents, fills all data fields, and creates character-specific scenarios aligned with your screenplay prompt approach.

I can see the current state of your enhanced scenario generator. Based on the conversation summary and the issues you've fixed, it looks like you've made significant improvements to handle document extraction, populate all fields with meaningful content, and create character-specific scenarios.

The key improvements you've implemented include:

1. **Enhanced Document Extraction**: Better parsing of Word documents with debugging and fallback methods
2. **Comprehensive Field Population**: All fields now get meaningful content instead of empty arrays
3. **Character-Specific Design**: AI plays specific roles (victim/bystander/perpetrator) with appropriate feedback
4. **Increased Token Limits**: From 8000 to 16000 for better extraction
5. **Template Structure Alignment**: Proper extraction from numbered sections

The system now properly:
- Extracts from Section 3.1 (AI Trainer Role) ‚Üí participant_roles.expert_role
- Extracts from Section 3.2 (AI Colleague Role) ‚Üí participant_roles.practice_role
- Maps Section 4.2 (Common Situations) ‚Üí knowledge_base.dos
- Maps Section 5.1 (Correction preferences) ‚Üí coaching_rules.correction_preferences
- Maps Section 5.2 (Success Metrics) ‚Üí success_metrics.kpis_for_interaction
- Maps Section 7.3 (Common Mistakes) ‚Üí knowledge_base.donts

The character-specific feedback mechanism ensures that:
- Learn Mode: AI acts as Senior HR Trainer teaching leadership
- Assess/Try Mode: AI stays in character as someone needing help
- Feedback responses are persona-specific, not generic training responses

Is there a specific aspect of the system you'd like me to help you with next, or are you looking to test/validate the current implementation?

i still feel like something might be missign from document ya know maybe write a api which will show me the extracted data not procssed just data in the document but with ya know sections of clear template i have what doya think or can i attach word file to you can you read it

---

Great idea! Let me create a simple API endpoint that shows you the raw extracted document data with clear section mapping. This will help you see exactly what's being extracted vs what might be missing.

---

Creating a debug API endpoint to show raw document extraction with clear section mapping

---

Now let me add this debug router to your flexible endpoints:

---

Adding debug router import to flexible endpoints

---

Including debug router in flexible endpoints

---

Perfect! Now you have a debug API endpoint. Here's how to use it:

**API Endpoint**: `POST /flexible/debug/raw-document-extraction`

**What it does**:
1. Extracts raw text from your Word document
2. Shows you exactly what sections it found
3. Maps each section to the template structure
4. Shows parsed fields vs raw content

**Usage**:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9000/flexible/debug/raw-document-extraction" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token" \
  -F "file=@your-document.docx"
```

**Response will show**:
- Raw text preview
- Parsed sections with exact content
- Field mappings (what goes where)
- Missing sections (if any)

This will help you see:
- ‚úÖ What sections are being found
- ‚ùå What sections are missing
- üîç Exact text being extracted
- üìã How it maps to your template structure

You can also attach your Word file here and I can read it directly to help debug the extraction. Just upload the file and I'll analyze what sections are present vs missing.

this is the value i got is it same on how you get data from .md file

Perfect! Now I can see the issue. The debug output shows that **all the data is actually there in the tables**, but the parsing logic is looking in the wrong places. The document structure is different from what the extraction logic expects.

**Key findings:**
1. ‚úÖ **All data is present** - it's in TABLE_0 through TABLE_9
2. ‚ùå **Parser is looking for paragraph text** instead of table data
3. ‚ùå **Section parsing is failing** because it expects different text patterns

Let me fix the extraction logic to properly parse the table data:

---

Updating extraction prompt to handle table-based document structure

---

Updating section mapping to match actual table structure found in document

---

Updating extraction priorities to match actual table data locations

---

Updating scenario understanding extraction to use table data

---

Updating scenario understanding extraction to use table data

---

Updating participant roles to extract from correct table locations

---

Updating knowledge base to extract from correct table data

---

Updating conversation topics to extract from table data

---

Updating correction preferences to extract from table data

---

Updating success metrics to extract from table data

---

Updating conversation dynamics to extract from table data

---

Now the extraction logic should properly parse the table data from your Word document. The key changes:

1. **Table-based extraction**: Now looks for TABLE_0 through TABLE_9 instead of section text
2. **Specific data mapping**: 
   - TABLE_3 ROW_1 ‚Üí AI Trainer Role
   - TABLE_4 ROW_1 ‚Üí AI Colleague Role  
   - TABLE_6 ‚Üí Common Situations (DOS)
   - TABLE_9 ‚Üí Common Mistakes (DONTS)
   - TABLE_8 ‚Üí Success Metrics

3. **Character-specific roles**: Extracts the exact roles:
   - Expert: "Senior HR Trainer in Learning and Development"
   - Practice: "A victim, a bystander, or a perpetuator"

Test the extraction again and it should now populate all fields with the actual document content instead of generic placeholders.

---

wait the extraction logic is in scenario_generator right

---

You're absolutely right! The extraction logic I just updated is in `enhanced_scenario_generator.py`, but the actual document text extraction from DOCX files happens in `scenario_generator.py`. 

The issue is that `scenario_generator.py` is extracting the document as "PARAGRAPH_X" format, but the enhanced generator is expecting regular text sections.

Let me check the current extraction in scenario_generator.py:

---

Yes, you're absolutely right! The extraction logic is in `scenario_generator.py`, not `enhanced_scenario_generator.py`. 

Looking at the debug output, I can see the issue clearly:

1. **DOCX extraction in `scenario_generator.py`** is working correctly - it's extracting all the table data as `TABLE_0_START`, `TABLE_1_START`, etc.

2. **But the enhanced extraction logic in `enhanced_scenario_generator.py`** is expecting regular text sections, not this table format.

The problem is that the two systems aren't aligned. Let me fix the `enhanced_scenario_generator.py` to properly parse the table format that `scenario_generator.py` produces:

---

Updating extraction to handle table format and increasing token limit

---


Now the extraction should work properly with your Word document. The key issue was that:

1. **`scenario_generator.py`** extracts Word docs as `TABLE_0_START`, `ROW_0: CELL_0: Field | CELL_1: Value` format
2. **`enhanced_scenario_generator.py`** now knows to parse this table format instead of looking for plain text sections

The debug output shows all your data is there:
- TABLE_0: Project basics (Course: "Effective Leadership", Module: "Essentials of a Good Leader", Scenario: "Leadership Fundamentals and Styles")
- TABLE_1: Target skills (5 leadership skills)
- TABLE_3: AI Trainer Role ("Senior HR Trainer in Learning and Development")
- TABLE_4: AI Colleague Role ("A victim, a bystander, or a perpetuator")
- TABLE_6: Common Situations (leadership scenarios)
- TABLE_8: Success Metrics (with specific targets)
- TABLE_9: Common Mistakes (leadership errors)

Test the extraction again and it should now populate all fields with the actual document content instead of generic placeholders.

what is this whyy change why is the api not working

The API is still generating generic content instead of extracting the actual data from your Word document. The issue is that even though we updated the prompt, the LLM is still not properly parsing the table format.

Let me fix this by creating a preprocessing function that converts the table format to readable text before sending to the LLM:

---

Adding table format parser to convert TABLE_X format to readable text before LLM processing

---

Simplifying extraction instructions to focus on content rather than table references

---


Now the system will:

1. **Parse the table format** from your Word document into readable sections
2. **Extract EXACT content** instead of generating generic responses
3. **Map the real data** to the correct template fields

The preprocessing function converts:
```
TABLE_3_START:
ROW_1: CELL_0: AI Trainer Role | CELL_1: Senior HR Trainer in Learning and Development
```

Into:
```
=== AI TRAINER DETAILS ===
AI Trainer Role: Senior HR Trainer in Learning and Development
```

This makes it much easier for the LLM to extract the actual content instead of generating generic placeholders.

Test the extraction again and you should now see the real data from your Word document instead of the generic "Character-specific positive response" type content.

Knowledge Base(ü§ñ Generated) maintain your prompt first i ahve a better idea i guess what you are doing is bad in my opion you are making it for a scenario you for got the main thing it was supposed to be universal remeber what i say is better than giving the extracted thing to the llm before cereteing  a template we need to make sure that whatver is in the doucment is extacted correctly alrigjht make sure of that first then , coming to the prompt of creating the exrtration rember its global adn the scenario prompts liek screen play thing you misunderstood the ai should play a role it is assigned to isntead i am getting dialouge klike
**Screenplay-Style Prompt: Leadership Assessment/Try Mode**

**Scene: Office Meeting Room**

**AI Character: Newly Promoted Leader**

**Character Background:** An employee who has recently been promoted to a leadership position, struggling to transition from peer to leader, and often unsure of how to balance authority with empathy.

---

**AI Character:** (Looking concerned) &quot;I‚Äôve been trying to lead my team effectively, but I keep feeling like I‚Äôm just telling them what to do rather than inspiring them. I know leadership is more than just authority, but I‚Äôm not sure how to build trust and credibility. What should I focus on?&quot;

---

**ASSESS MODE:**

**AI Character:** &quot;I‚Äôve heard about different leadership styles, like transformational and democratic, but I‚Äôm not sure which one fits my team best. I tend to stick to what I know, but maybe that‚Äôs not working. How do I adapt my style to suit different situations?&quot;

You're absolutely right! I was overcomplicating it. The main issue is:

1. **First**: Extract the document data correctly 
2. **Second**: Create a universal template system that works for any scenario
3. **Third**: The AI should PLAY the assigned role, not generate dialogue examples

Let me fix the core extraction first to make sure we get the actual document data:

---

Replacing LLM-dependent parsing with direct data extraction from table format

---

Now let me fix the template generation to be universal and role-based instead of dialogue-based:

---

Using extracted raw data directly instead of LLM-generated content

---

Replacing LLM-based extraction with direct data mapping from raw extracted data

---

Completely rewriting the enhanced scenario generator to extract data directly from tables without LLM processing

---


Now the system will:

1. **Extract raw data directly** from the table format without LLM processing
2. **Map the actual document content** to template fields
3. **Create a universal template** that works for any scenario
4. **Use the exact roles** from your document instead of generating generic content

The key fix is that it now extracts:
- **AI Trainer Role**: "Senior HR Trainer in Learning and Development" 
- **AI Colleague Role**: "A victim, a bystander, or a perpetuator"
- **Target Skills**: All 5 leadership skills from your document
- **Success Metrics**: Actual metrics with percentages
- **Common Mistakes**: Real mistakes from your document

Test the extraction again and you should see the actual document data instead of generic AI-generated content.

no no no let me draw out the issue and fix you need to do alright
first i upload a document alright which is a docx and some data is missing when i try to create the template the fix for this to make sure the data is there and then move to create the template which will be get checked and verified byt the user and then proceed to generate prompts which will act upon the persona that is generated and the uphold on what i have as a template that is the old one i have no but change something in that so that it will more dynamic not rigid so now you got it tell me what is your plan and ill aproove it

---


Got it! Here's my plan:

## Issue Analysis
1. **Document Upload** ‚Üí DOCX extraction is missing data
2. **Template Creation** ‚Üí Should use ACTUAL extracted data, not AI-generated content
3. **User Verification** ‚Üí User checks/edits template before proceeding
4. **Prompt Generation** ‚Üí Create dynamic prompts from verified template + personas

## My Fix Plan

### Step 1: Fix Document Extraction
- Improve the `_extract_raw_data()` function to capture ALL table data correctly
- Add better parsing for complex table structures
- Ensure no data is lost during DOCX ‚Üí table format conversion

### Step 2: Direct Data Mapping (No LLM for extraction)
- Map extracted data directly to template fields
- Use `extraction_source: "FROM_DOCUMENT"` for real data
- Only use `extraction_source: "GENERATED_CONTENT"` for missing fields

### Step 3: Make Template Dynamic (Not Rigid)
- Keep the existing template structure but make it flexible
- Allow any role types (not just "trainer/customer")
- Support any domain/scenario type
- Make prompts adapt to the actual roles from document

### Step 4: Dynamic Prompt Generation
- Generate prompts that use the ACTUAL roles from template
- AI plays the assigned character role (victim/bystander/perpetrator)
- Prompts adapt to any scenario type, not hardcoded leadership

**Key Changes:**
1. Fix table parsing to get ALL data
2. Direct mapping (no LLM guessing)
3. Dynamic role-based prompts
4. Universal template system

Should I proceed with this plan?

You stopped your current work and asked me to work on the following task instead.

your limit is gonna end you list the things you need to be prompted so that i can continue this context alright

## Context to Continue:

**Main Issue:** DOCX extraction missing data ‚Üí template creation fails ‚Üí need dynamic prompts

**Key Files:**
- `enhanced_scenario_generator.py` - extraction logic
- `scenario_generator.py` - DOCX processing  
- `debug_extraction.py` - shows table format parsing

**Current State:**
- DOCX extracts as TABLE_X_START/ROW_X format
- Raw data extraction function exists but incomplete
- Template
