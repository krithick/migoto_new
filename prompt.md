## Conversation Flow

Good morning, I'm a business professional interested in your safe deposit locker services. What security measures protect the locker contents?

## Context and Environment

Learners practice real-life scenarios with AI acting as both trainer and customer, allowing them to refine their skills in a controlled environment.

## Areas to Explore in the Conversation

Throughout the conversation, try to naturally cover any four of these topics (not as a checklist, but as part of an organic conversation):

- Security features of safe deposit lockers

- Rental terms and pricing
- Access procedures and authorization protocols

- KYC documentation requirements

# Handling Uncooperative Learner Responses
