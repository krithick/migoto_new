take a look at the scneario prompt template ??? , when i use the language placeholder it drifts may i know why

---

Looking at your scenario prompt templates, the `[LANGUAGE_INSTRUCTIONS]` placeholder is likely causing drift because:

1. **Placement Issue**: It's at the very top of the template, making it the first thing the AI sees, which can override subsequent character instructions.

2. **No Context Binding**: The language instruction isn't tied to the character role, so the AI might interpret it as a separate system-level instruction rather than part of the character's behavior.

3. **Competing Instructions**: When language instructions come before character rules, they can conflict with the persona-specific behavior you want.

**Quick Fix**: Move `[LANGUAGE_INSTRUCTIONS]` after the core character establishment:

```python
def _load_learn_mode_template(self):
    return """# {title} - Learn Mode

## Core Character Rules

- You are an AI playing the role of a {expert_role} specializing in {specialization}
- NEVER play the {learner_role} role - only respond as the {expert_role}
- Maintain a {tone} and educational tone throughout

[LANGUAGE_INSTRUCTIONS]

## Character Background
[PERSONA_PLACEHOLDER]
...
```

**Better Fix**: Integrate language instructions into character rules:

```python
- You are an AI playing the role of a {expert_role} specializing in {specialization}
- Communicate in the language specified: [LANGUAGE_INSTRUCTIONS]
- NEVER play the {learner_role} role - only respond as the {expert_role}
```

This binds the language requirement to the character role, reducing drift.

---

i have put the [LANGUAGE_INSTRUCTIONS] in the bottom of the prompt

---

If you've moved `[LANGUAGE_INSTRUCTIONS]` to the bottom and still experiencing drift, the issue is likely:

**1. Weak Binding**: Language instructions at the bottom are easily overridden by the conversation flow. The AI prioritizes recent context over distant instructions.

**2. Template Structure**: Your templates have many competing priorities (character rules, conversation flow, knowledge base, etc.) that can dilute the language instruction.

**Quick Solutions**:

**Option 1 - Reinforce in Character Rules:**
```python
## Core Character Rules
- You are an AI playing the role of a {expert_role} specializing in {specialization}
- ALWAYS respond in the specified language throughout the entire conversation
- NEVER play the {learner_role} role - only respond as the {expert_role}
```

**Option 2 - Add to Conversation Closing:**
```python
## Conversation Closing (Important)
- Positive closing (if the learner demonstrates understanding): "{positive_closing} [FINISH]"
- Remember to maintain the specified language in all responses
```

**Option 3 - Strengthen the placeholder content:**
Instead of just `[LANGUAGE_INSTRUCTIONS]`, use:
```
[LANGUAGE_INSTRUCTIONS] - This language requirement applies to ALL your responses throughout the conversation.
```

The most effective approach is **Option 1** - integrating language requirements directly into the core character rules where they can't be overlooked.

---

Language Instructions:
If the user speaks in Hindi, respond in a natural mix of Hindi and English.

Use proper Hindi script (Devanagari) for Hindi portions and Roman script for English terms.

IMPORTANT: ALL responses, feedback, conversation endings, and system messages should be in Hindi-English mix, not pure English.

Language Mixing Guidelines:
- Keep technical terms, professional terminology, and numbers in English (Roman script)
- Use Hindi script (देवनागरी) for conversational flow, emotions, and transitions
- Mix both scripts naturally within sentences

Example Response Patterns:
- &quot;बहुत बढ़िया! आपने customer की needs को समझकर proper recommendation दिया।&quot;
- &quot;चलिए फिर से try करते हैं। इस बार customer के concerns को address करने पर focus करें।&quot;
- &quot;आपका approach अच्छा था, लेकिन SPIN questioning और भी बेहतर हो सकती थी।&quot;

Feedback and Closing Examples:
- &quot;Perfect! आपने बिल्कुल सही तरीके से handle किया। [FINISH]&quot;
- &quot;थोड़ा और practice की जरूरत है। Customer को पहले comfortable feel कराना चाहिए। [FINISH]&quot; 
- &quot;[CORRECT] यहाँ आपको customer के emotional state को पहले समझना चाहिए था। [CORRECT]&quot;

This mixed approach should be used throughout the entire conversation including all system responses and feedback.
this is the prompt but for some reason while using this the prompts drifts heavily

---

The drift is happening because your language instruction is **too complex and conflicting** with the character's core behavior. Here's why:

**Problems:**
1. **Cognitive Load**: The AI has to juggle character role + complex language mixing rules + conversation flow
2. **Script Switching**: Constantly deciding between Devanagari/Roman creates decision fatigue
3. **Example Overload**: Multiple example patterns confuse the core character focus

**Simple Fix - Reduce Complexity:**

```
Language Instructions:
Respond in Hindi-English mix. Use Hindi for conversation, English for technical terms.
Example: "बहुत अच्छा! आपका approach सही था।"
```

**Better Fix - Integrate into Character:**

```python
## Core Character Rules
- You are an AI playing the role of a {expert_role} specializing in {specialization}
- Communicate naturally in Hindi-English mix (Hindi for conversation, English for technical terms)
- NEVER play the {learner_role} role - only respond as the {expert_role}
```

**Best Fix - Character-Specific Language:**

```python
## Character Background
[PERSONA_PLACEHOLDER]
*This character naturally speaks in Hindi-English mix, using Hindi for emotions/conversation and English for technical terms.*
```

The key is making language feel like a **natural character trait** rather than a separate instruction competing with the role-play behavior.

---

the prompt is need to be

---

I understand you need the prompt to be exactly as you specified. The drift is happening because the complex language instructions are **competing with character consistency**.

**Root Cause**: The AI is prioritizing language rules over character behavior, breaking immersion.

**Minimal Fix - Add Character Anchor:**

Add this single line right after your Core Character Rules:

```python
- Maintain your character role consistently while following the language mixing guidelines below
```

Then keep your existing `[LANGUAGE_INSTRUCTIONS]` exactly as is.

This creates a hierarchy: Character role FIRST, then language rules, preventing the language instructions from overriding the persona behavior.

The drift happens because without this anchor, the AI treats language mixing as the primary task instead of a secondary formatting requirement.

---

will this work ???

---

**Yes, this should significantly reduce drift.**

The anchor line creates a clear **priority hierarchy**:
1. Stay in character (primary)
2. Follow language rules (secondary)

Without it, the AI treats both as equal priorities, causing conflict and drift.

**Why it works:**
- Establishes character consistency as the dominant instruction
- Makes language mixing subordinate to role-play behavior
- Prevents the complex language rules from overriding persona

**Test it with a few conversations** - you should see the AI maintain character better while still following your Hindi-English mixing guidelines.

If you still get drift, the fallback is to simplify the language instruction to just: "Respond in Hindi-English mix naturally" and remove the detailed examples.

---

ok you know how my chat works i need a script to check or handle the drifting i run the program and context and a llm should verify is the scneario is drifted or not do you get my point ???

---

Yes, I get it! You need an automated drift detection script that analyzes your chat conversations to identify when the AI breaks character.

---

Creating a drift detection script that analyzes chat conversations to identify when AI breaks character or deviates from expected behavior

---

Now you can run it like:

```bash
python drift_detector.py <session_id>
```

The script will:
1. **Analyze the conversation** against the expected character behavior
2. **Detect drift types**: role confusion, language drift, character breaking, etc.
3. **Score the drift** (0-100)
4. **Identify problematic responses** with explanations
5. **Provide recommendations** for fixing the prompts

This gives you automated feedback on whether your scenarios are staying in character or drifting.

---

now take this context and for the avatar interaction this has persona languases assigned check for all langages have a small convo fipo hope it is getting the bench mark ya know make it automated even better i give a snceario id then you go ahead and test witb the avatartinteraction id given you know how a scneario is built

---

Creating an automated drift tester that takes a scenario ID and tests all avatar interactions across all assigned languages with benchmark conversations

---

Now you can run:

```bash
python automated_drift_tester.py <scenario_id>
```

**What it does:**
1. **Takes scenario ID** → finds all avatar interactions (learn/try/assess modes)
2. **For each avatar interaction** → gets all assigned languages  
3. **For each language** → runs benchmark conversations (3-4 test messages per mode)
4. **Analyzes each response** → checks for drift, language compliance, character consistency
5. **Generates overall score** → PASS/FAIL with detailed breakdown

**Output:**
- Overall drift score (0-100)
- Per-language, per-mode results
- Specific drift issues found
- Recommendations for fixes
- Detailed JSON report saved to file

This gives you **automated benchmarking** across all your scenario's language combinations to catch drift before deployment.

---

how does this give me a simple flow because i have to make sure it works fine alright

---

You're right, let me give you the **simple flow**:

## How It Works:

1. **You run:** `python automated_drift_tester.py <scenario_id>`

2. **Script does:**
   - Gets scenario → finds 3 avatar interactions (learn/try/assess)
   - For each interaction → gets assigned languages 
   - For each language → runs 3 test conversations
   - Checks if AI stays in character + follows language rules

3. **You get:**
   ```
   📊 DRIFT TEST RESULTS
   Scenario: Customer Service Training
   Overall Score: 25/100
   Status: PASS ✅
   Languages Tested: 6
   ```

## Simple Test Flow:

**Input:** Scenario ID  
**Process:** Auto-tests all language combinations  
**Output:** PASS/FAIL + specific issues

## What You Check:
- Does AI stay in character across all languages?
- Does language mixing work properly?
- Are responses consistent?

## Quick Validation:
- **Score < 30** = Good to go ✅
- **Score > 30** = Fix prompts ❌

**That's it.** One command tells you if your scenario works across all assigned languages or needs fixing.

---

is tour quesitons about the scneario or generarl ??

---

The test questions are **general** right now:

```python
self.test_conversations = {
    "learn_mode": [
        "Hello, I need help with customer service best practices.",
        "Can you explain how to handle difficult customers?",
        "What should I do if a customer is angry?"
    ],
    "try_mode": [
        "Hi, I'm having trouble with my order.",
        "I placed an order last week but haven't received it yet.",
        "Can you help me track my package?"
    ]
}
```

**Should they be scenario-specific?**

If yes, I can modify it to:
1. **Extract scenario context** from the template/knowledge base
2. **Generate relevant questions** based on the actual scenario content
3. **Test with domain-specific conversations** (e.g., insurance vs sales vs healthcare)

**Which do you prefer:**
- **General questions** (tests basic character consistency)
- **Scenario-specific questions** (tests domain knowledge + character)

For drift detection, **general questions** might be better since they focus purely on character consistency rather than domain accuracy.

---

scneario specific you will have the prompts i mean you know where it is in the avatat interaction document so 
also i need to know where and how it drifted can ya do that and save the prompts used and convos in json if possible

---

Updating the drift tester to generate scenario-specific questions, provide detailed drift analysis with exact locations, and save all prompts and conversations in JSON format

---

Now the script:

## **Scenario-Specific Testing:**
- **Extracts context** from your scenario's template data
- **Generates relevant questions** based on domain/role/context
- **Tests with realistic conversations** for that specific scenario

## **Detailed Drift Analysis:**
- **Exact location** where drift occurred
- **What should have happened** vs **what actually happened**
- **Specific explanations** for each type of drift
- **Role, language, character consistency** scores

## **Complete Logging:**
- **All prompts used** (system + language instructions)
- **Full conversation logs** with turn-by-turn analysis
- **Drift detection** at each message
- **JSON export** with everything for debugging

## **Output Example:**
```json
{
  "detailed_analysis": {
    "drift_location": "AI mentioned being an AI assistant instead of staying in customer role",
    "expected_behavior": "Should respond as frustrated customer seeking help",
    "actual_behavior": "Broke character and offered to help as AI assistant"
  },
  "full_conversation_log": {
    "system_prompt_used": "...",
    "messages": [...]
  }
}
```

**Now you get:** Scenario-specific testing + exact drift locations + all prompts/conversations saved for debugging.

some errors here and 
how i wanted it to be tested is that for every language have a first greeting chat alright use different languages assigned and check if the first message itself is good or not for example when i say hi to a try or access mode it shouldnt be saying how may i help you is totally wrong right you should check the response with the proimpt you may have to have a prompt for it too you get me check with me beofre generating code

---

I see the issues:

1. **JSON parsing error** - The LLM is not returning valid JSON
2. **Wrong testing approach** - You want to test the **first greeting** in each language to see if AI starts correctly

## Your Requirements:
- **Test first message only** per language
- **Use different greetings** in assigned languages (Hi, नमस्ते, etc.)
- **Check if AI responds appropriately** for the mode:
  - **try_mode**: Should act like customer/client (NOT offer help)
  - **assess_mode**: Should act like customer/client (NOT offer help) 
  - **learn_mode**: Should act like expert (CAN offer help)

## Proposed Approach:
```python
# Test greetings per language
test_greetings = {
    "english": "Hi there!",
    "hindi": "नमस्ते!",
    "spanish": "¡Hola!",
    # etc.
}

# Check if first response is appropriate for mode
expected_behavior = {
    "try_mode": "Should act as customer/client seeking help, NOT offering help",
    "assess_mode": "Should act as customer/client with problem, NOT offering help", 
    "learn_mode": "Should act as expert/trainer, CAN offer help"
}
```

**Questions:**
1. Should I map languages to specific greetings, or use generic "Hi" for all?
2. Do you want to test ONLY the first greeting, or a few exchanges?
3. Should I fix the JSON parsing issue first, then modify the testing approach?

Confirm this approach before I code it.

---

i have assigned hindi tamil and english take details from avatar interaction  try mode and assess are virtually same use languafe specific first messaghe and some instances yes fix the issue 
and tell me how are tou going to verify it

---

## My Plan:

**1. Fix JSON parsing issue:**
- Add JSON extraction with fallback parsing
- Handle malformed LLM responses

**2. Language-specific greetings:**
```python
language_greetings = {
    "hindi": ["नमस्ते!", "हैलो!", "मैं आपकी मदद चाहिए।"],
    "tamil": ["வணக்கம்!", "ஹலோ!", "எனக்கு உதவி வேண்டும்।"], 
    "english": ["Hi!", "Hello!", "I need some help."]
}
```

**3. Mode-specific verification:**
```python
expected_behavior = {
    "try_mode": "Should respond as customer/client with a problem, NOT as helpful assistant",
    "assess_mode": "Should respond as customer/client with a problem, NOT as helpful assistant",
    "learn_mode": "Should respond as expert/trainer offering guidance"
}
```

**4. Verification Method:**
- Send language-specific greeting
- Check if AI response matches expected role for that mode
- Look for phrases like "How can I help" (wrong for try/assess) vs customer complaints (correct)

**5. Test Flow:**
- Get avatar interaction → extract assigned languages (hindi/tamil/english)
- For each language → send 2-3 greetings in that language
- Verify first response matches mode expectations
- Score: Does AI stay in character from the very first message?

**Should I proceed with this approach?**

---

verification  with a llm rigjht ??

---

**Yes, verification with LLM.**

## Verification Flow:

**1. Send greeting** → Get AI response
**2. LLM Verifier checks:**
```python
verification_prompt = f"""
EXPECTED ROLE: {mode} - {expected_behavior[mode]}
LANGUAGE: {language_name}
USER GREETING: {greeting}
AI RESPONSE: {ai_response}

Is the AI response appropriate for this role and mode?

Check:
- Does AI stay in character for {mode}?
- Is language mixing correct for {language_name}?
- Does response match expected behavior?

JSON: {{"appropriate": true/false, "issues": ["list"], "score": 0-100}}
"""
```

**3. Verifier LLM** analyzes if:
- **try_mode/assess_mode**: AI acts like customer (✅) or offers help (❌)
- **learn_mode**: AI acts like expert/trainer (✅)
- **Language**: Follows language mixing rules correctly

**4. Get score** for each greeting test

This way we use **one LLM for conversation**, **another LLM for verification** - cleaner separation.

**Proceed with this verification approach?**

---

yes

---

Updating the drift tester to use language-specific greetings, test first responses only, and use LLM verifier with proper JSON parsing fallback

---

Fixing the overall assessment calculation and adding the missing language greetings method

---

Now the script:

## **Fixed Issues:**
1. **JSON parsing** - Added fallback extraction with regex
2. **Language-specific greetings** - Hindi/Tamil/English from avatar interaction
3. **First message testing** - Only tests initial greetings, not full conversations

## **Verification Method:**
- **LLM Verifier** checks each first response for:
  - **Role appropriateness** (try/assess = customer, learn = expert)
  - **Language compliance** (Hindi-English mixing rules)
  - **Character consistency** (stays in character from first message)

## **What You Get:**
```
📊 DRIFT TEST RESULTS
Overall Score: 85/100
Status: PASS ✅
Languages Tested: 6

✅ ALL FIRST RESPONSES APPROPRIATE
```

## **Test Flow:**
1. **Hindi**: "नमस्ते!" → Check if AI responds as customer (try/assess) or expert (learn)
2. **Tamil**: "வணக்கம்!" → Same verification
3. **English**: "Hi there!" → Same verification

**Score ≥70 = PASS**, **Score <70 = FAIL** with specific issues identified.

---

Removing the call to the old scenario questions generator since we're now using language-specific greetings

---

Now the error should be fixed. The script will:

1. **Skip scenario question generation** (was causing JSON parsing error)
2. **Use language-specific greetings** directly from the predefined list
3. **Test first responses only** with LLM verifier

Run it again - the JSON parsing error should be gone since we're no longer calling the problematic `_generate_scenario_questions` method.

Fixing all the issues: removing unused method, updating function signature, replacing old analysis with new verification method

---

Now all errors should be fixed:

1. ✅ **Removed unused `_generate_scenario_questions` method**
2. ✅ **Fixed `_test_language_conversation` signature** - removed `test_questions` parameter
3. ✅ **Replaced old drift analysis with new LLM verifier**
4. ✅ **Added proper JSON parsing with fallback**
5. ✅ **Updated to use language-specific greetings**

The script now:
- **Tests first greetings only** in Hindi/Tamil/English
- **Uses LLM verifier** to check appropriateness 
- **No more JSON parsing errors**
- **Clean, focused testing approach**

Run it again - should work without errors now.

this seems to be a good but it says a issue better make suer of the expected behaviour before continuing ig ??

---

You're absolutely right! The issue is that the **expected behavior definition is too generic**. 

Looking at the AI response: *"Hello! I need to share some customer data with our vendor for a project. What should I do according to our policies?"*

This **IS** appropriate for try_mode - the AI is acting as a colleague asking for help, **NOT** offering help like "How can I help you?"

## Problem:
The verifier doesn't understand the **specific character role** from the system prompt. It only sees generic "try_mode = customer/client" but this scenario has a **"Concerned Colleague"** character.

## Fix:
Extract the **actual character role** from the system prompt and use that for verification instead of generic mode descriptions.

**Should I:**
1. **Extract bot_role** from avatar_interaction (e.g., "Concerned Colleague") 
2. **Update verification prompt** to use specific character instead of generic "customer/client"
3. **Make expected behavior more specific** to the actual scenario context

This way the verifier will check: *"Is AI acting as Concerned Colleague asking for guidance?"* instead of *"Is AI acting as generic customer?"*

**Proceed with this fix?**

---

yess also let me interact with thet terminal to select or make sure the behavipirs are true

---

Adding character role extraction from system prompt and interactive verification mode where user can manually approve/reject each response

---

Now you can run:

## **Automatic Mode:**
```bash
python automated_drift_tester.py <scenario_id>
```

## **Interactive Mode:**
```bash
python automated_drift_tester.py <scenario_id> --interactive
```

## **What Interactive Mode Does:**

For each AI response, you'll see:
```
🔍 INTERACTIVE VERIFICATION - TRY_MODE - English
============================================================
USER GREETING: Hi there!
AI RESPONSE: Hello! I need to share some customer data with our vendor for a project. What should I do according to our policies?

AUTO-VERIFICATION:
  Appropriate: false
  Score: 40/100
  Character Role: Concerned Colleague
  Issues: AI response does not match expected role

============================================================

Is this response APPROPRIATE for the character? (y/n/s to skip):
```

**Your Options:**
- **y** = Override as appropriate (score becomes 90)
- **n** = Confirm inappropriate + add your reason
- **s** = Skip, keep auto-verification

## **Improvements:**
1. **Character role extraction** - Now detects "Concerned Colleague" from system prompt
2. **Interactive verification** - You decide what's actually appropriate
3. **Better context** - Uses specific character role instead of generic mode rules

This gives you **manual control** over what's considered appropriate behavior.

---

ok this is good but i wanted to make sure of the expected chatracter responses ya know

---

Ah, you want to **verify the expected character responses** before running the test! Let me add a preview mode:

---

Adding preview mode to check and confirm expected character behaviors before running tests

---

Now you can:

## **Preview Mode (Check Expected Behaviors):**
```bash
python automated_drift_tester.py <scenario_id> --preview
```

**Shows you:**
```
🎯 SCENARIO: Customer Service Training

   Character Role: Customer Service Expert
   Bot Role Field: expert
   System Prompt Preview: You are a customer service expert specializing in...
   Expected Behavior: Should act as expert/trainer offering guidance

   Is this the correct expected behavior for Customer Service Expert? (y/n): y
   ✅ Confirmed expectation

💭 TRY_MODE:
   Character Role: Concerned Colleague
   Bot Role Field: colleague
   System Prompt Preview: You are a concerned colleague who needs to share...
   Expected Behavior: Should act as Concerned Colleague seeking help/guidance, NOT offering help

   ✅ Confirmed expectation
```

## **Then Run Tests:**
```bash
python automated_drift_tester.py <scenario_id>           # Auto mode
python automated_drift_tester.py <scenario_id> -i       # Interactive mode
```

**This way you:**
1. **Preview & confirm** what each character should do
2. **Adjust expectations** if the auto-detection is wrong
3. **Then run tests** with confidence in the expected behaviors

---

how are you getting the extracted behaviour jsut tell me that part first

---

The character role extraction uses regex patterns on the system prompt:

```python
def _extract_character_role(self, system_prompt: str, bot_role: str) -> str:
    import re
    
    # Common patterns for character roles
    patterns = [
        r"You are (?:an? )?([^.\n]+?)(?:\.|\n)",           # "You are a customer service expert"
        r"playing the role of (?:an? )?([^.\n]+?)(?:\.|\n)", # "playing the role of concerned colleague"
        r"act as (?:an? )?([^.\n]+?)(?:\.|\n)",            # "act as a frustrated customer"
        r"character.*?([A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+)",          # "character: Concerned Colleague"
    ]
    
    for pattern in patterns:
        match = re.search(pattern, system_prompt, re.IGNORECASE)
        if match:
            role = match.group(1).strip()
            if len(role) > 5 and len(role) < 50:  # Reasonable length
                return role
    
    # Fallback to bot_role if no match
    return bot_role or "AI assistant"
```

**It looks for:**
- "You are a **concerned colleague**" → extracts "concerned colleague"
- "playing the role of **customer service expert**" → extracts "customer service expert"  
- "act as **frustrated customer**" → extracts "frustrated customer"

**Fallback:** Uses the `bot_role` field from avatar_interaction if regex finds nothing.

**Is this extraction method working correctly for your prompts?**

---

no use llm with fully built prompts from avatar interaction id whenerver i run the code first  it should veriy the behaviours and then carry on the things

---

Replacing regex extraction with LLM-based character behavior extraction using full prompts, and making behavior verification mandatory before running tests

---

Replacing regex-based character extraction with LLM-based extraction using full prompts, and making behavior verification mandatory at the start of every test run

---

Now when you run:

```bash
python automated_drift_tester.py <scenario_id>
```

**It will ALWAYS:**

1. **First verify behaviors** using LLM with full prompts:
```
🔍 VERIFYING EXPECTED BEHAVIORS
Scenario: Customer Service Training
============================================================

📋 TRY_MODE:
   Character Role: Concerned Colleague
   Expected Behavior: Acts as a worried employee seeking guidance about data sharing policies
   Help Direction: seeks_help

   Is this correct for try_mode? (y/n/q to quit): y
   ✅ Confirmed
```

2. **Then run tests** only if you confirm all behaviors are correct

**The LLM extracts character info from:**
- Full system prompt with `[LANGUAGE_INSTRUCTIONS]` replaced
- Complete avatar interaction context
- Mode-specific analysis

**You get to verify** that the extracted character behavior matches what you expect before any testing begins.

          }
        },

---

The error is `avatar_interaction_id` is not defined in the verification function call. Let me fix it:

---

Fixing the undefined avatar_interaction_id variable by using the correct avatar_interaction object reference

---

Fixed the `avatar_interaction_id` undefined error. The issue was trying to use a variable that wasn't in scope - now it correctly uses `avatar_interaction.get("_id", "")` to get the ID from the avatar_interaction object.

Run the script again - the error should be resolved.

---

{
              &quot;greeting&quot;: &quot;Hi there!&quot;,
              &quot;error&quot;: &quot;name &#39;avatar_interaction&#39; is not defined&quot;
            },
            {
              &quot;greeting&quot;: &quot;Hello, I need some help.&quot;,
              &quot;error&quot;: &quot;name &#39;avatar_interaction&#39; is not defined&quot;
            },
            {
              &quot;greeting&quot;: &quot;I have an issue.&quot;,
              &quot;error&quot;: &quot;name &#39;avatar_interaction&#39; is not defined&quot;
            }
Still the whole json is of this how can i hekpo

---

The `avatar_interaction` variable is not available in the `_verify_response_with_llm` function. Let me fix this by passing the avatar_interaction_id directly:

---

Fixing the avatar_interaction undefined error by passing avatar_interaction_id as a parameter to the verification function

---

Adding avatar_interaction_id parameter to the verification function and passing it correctly from the calling code

---

Fixed the variable scope issue by:

1. **Added `avatar_interaction_id` parameter** to `_verify_response_with_llm` function
2. **Passed the ID correctly** from the calling code using `str(avatar_interaction.get("_id", ""))`
3. **Used the parameter** instead of trying to access undefined variables

Now the verification function has access to the avatar_interaction_id it needs. Run the script again - the "name not defined" errors should be resolved.

---

how can i increase the number of iteration or increase the number of conversation parir in one iteration dont do anything just tell me how

---


To increase iterations/conversation pairs:

## **Option 1: More greetings per language**
In `self.language_greetings`, add more greetings to each language array:
```python
"hindi": ["नमस्ते!", "हैलो!", "मुझे help चाहिए।", "क्या आप मदद कर सकते हैं?", "एक समस्या है।"]
```

## **Option 2: Multiple conversation turns**
In `_test_language_conversation`, after the first greeting, continue the conversation:
- Send follow-up messages based on AI's response
- Create a loop for 2-3 exchanges instead of just 1 greeting

## **Option 3: Test different scenarios per language**
Add scenario-specific test cases:
```python
test_scenarios = {
    "data_sharing": "I need to share customer data...",
    "password_issue": "My password expired...", 
    "phishing_concern": "I got a suspicious email..."
}
```

## **Option 4: Repeat tests with different temperatures**
Run the same greeting multiple times with different LLM temperature settings (0.3, 0.7, 0.9) to test consistency.

**Which approach do you want to implement?**

---

option 4 ig

---


For Option 4, you need to modify the `_test_language_conversation` function:

**Current:** Tests each greeting once at temperature 0.7

**Change to:** Test each greeting multiple times with different temperatures

**Where to modify:**
```python
# In _test_language_conversation function
temperatures = [0.3, 0.7, 0.9]  # Add this

for i, greeting in enumerate(greetings):
    for temp_idx, temperature in enumerate(temperatures):  # Add this loop
        print(f"    💬 Greeting {i+1} (temp {temperature}): {greeting}")
        
        # In the LLM call, change:
        temperature=temperature,  # Instead of temperature=0.7
```

**Result:** 
- 3 greetings × 3 temperatures = **9 tests per language**
- Each greeting tested at 0.3 (conservative), 0.7 (balanced), 0.9 (creative)
- Shows consistency across different response styles

**Want me to implement this change?**

---

yes do it

---

Adding multiple temperature testing - each greeting is now tested 3 times with different temperatures (0.3, 0.7, 0.9) to check consistency

---

Adding multiple temperature testing - each greeting is now tested 3 times with different temperatures (0.3, 0.7, 0.9) to check consistency

---


Done! Now each greeting will be tested **3 times** with different temperatures:

- **Temperature 0.3** (conservative/consistent responses)
- **Temperature 0.7** (balanced responses) 
- **Temperature 0.9** (creative/varied responses)

**Result:**
- **3 greetings × 3 temperatures = 9 tests per language**
- **3 languages × 9 tests = 27 tests per mode**
- **3 modes × 27 tests = 81 total tests per scenario**

**Output includes:**
- `temperature` field in each result
- `total_tests` count 
- `temperatures_used` array
- Turn counter tracks all 9 tests per language

This tests **consistency** - good characters should behave appropriately regardless of temperature setting.
