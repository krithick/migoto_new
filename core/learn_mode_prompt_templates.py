**Template Structure:**

## THE [METHODOLOGY NAME] FRAMEWORK

**Overview:**
[Brief description of the framework - what it is, why it exists]

**The Steps:**

### Step 1: [Step Name]

**What It Is:**
[Clear explanation of this step - 30-50 words]

**Why It Matters:**
[Why this step is important]

**Instead Do:**
- ✅ [Correct approach 1]
- ✅ [Correct approach 2]

---

[Repeat for each step]

---

**Putting It All Together:**
[Show how all steps flow together in a complete example]


**Example (IMPACT Methodology):**

## THE IMPACT METHODOLOGY

**Overview:**
IMPACT is a 6-step framework for conducting effective pharmaceutical sales 
calls. Each letter stands for a critical step in the sales process.

**The Steps:**

### Step 1: I - Introduce

**What It Is:**
Introduce yourself, establish credibility, and build rapport with the doctor.

**Why It Matters:**
First impressions set the tone. Doctors are busy - you need to quickly show 
you're professional and respect their time.

**How to Do It:**
1. State your name and company
2. Thank them for their time
3. State your purpose clearly
4. Ask permission to proceed

**Example:**
"Hello Dr. Sharma, I'm John from PharmaCorp. Thank you for taking a few minutes. 
I'd like to share information about a new endometriosis treatment that addresses 
some concerns you may have with current options. May I proceed?"

**Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ Being too casual or overly friendly
- ❌ Not stating purpose clearly
- ❌ Launching into pitch without permission

**Instead Do:**
- ✅ Professional but warm greeting
- ✅ Clear, concise purpose statement
- ✅ Respect their time explicitly

[Continue for M, P, A, C, T steps...]


**Example (Customer Service):**

## THE CARE FRAMEWORK

**Overview:**
CARE is a 4-step framework for responding to difficult customer situations 
professionally and effectively.

### Step 1: C - Clarify

**What It Is:**
Ask questions to fully understand the customer's issue before responding.

**Why It Matters:**
Jumping to solutions without understanding often makes things worse. Customers 
want to feel heard.

**How to Do It:**
1. Ask open-ended questions: "Can you tell me more about what happened?"
2. Listen actively without interrupting
3. Summarize to confirm understanding: "So if I understand correctly..."

**Example:**
Customer: "Your product doesn't work!"
You: "I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me specifically what's happening 
when you try to use it? That will help me understand how to help."
